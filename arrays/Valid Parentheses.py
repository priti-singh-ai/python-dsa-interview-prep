Problem: Valid Parentheses
You are given a string s consisting of the following characters: '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']'.

The input string s is valid if and only if:

Every open bracket is closed by the same type of close bracket.
Open brackets are closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
Return true if s is a valid string, and false otherwise.
Example:
Input: s = "[]"

Output: true

Difficulty: Easy
Pattern: HashMap

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
